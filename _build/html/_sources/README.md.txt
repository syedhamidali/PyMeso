# PyMeso

An implementation of the linear least squares derivative method for calculating azimuthal shear from Doppler velocity data. This is used operationally for detecting mesocyclones and is based on the work by Miller et al., (2013). 
Additionally, a method for simulating rankine vortices has been provided and was used in the verification process for the LLSD method.
